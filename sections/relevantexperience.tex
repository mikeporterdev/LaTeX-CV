		I am responsible for designing and developing CRM systems and end-user customer sites for telecoms service providers. I perform full-stack development using Java, Spring, Hibernate and Struts.

		I also have a major role in developing and maintaining internal maintenance tools by moving regular support tasks into an easily usable Django webapp to ease strain on service delivery teams.

		\item Designed and implemented a front-end overhaul on an aging CRM system, focusing on best practices, usability and speed. This provided a much more intuitive experience, reducing the training and support required to use the system.
		\item Part of a two-person development team implementing the rebranding of LIFE Mobile to Plusnet Mobile. This followed strict design and accessibility guidelines and provided a well received customer self-service website, with fully responsive design. 
		\item Implemented optimisations on the main CRM system, increasing the speed of page load times almost ten-fold across the board, saving both client time company resources.
		\item Came second place in a company-wide hackathon, developing a prototype front-end for a mobile provisioning system using ReactJS.
