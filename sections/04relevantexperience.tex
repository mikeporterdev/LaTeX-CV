    \hspace*{\fill}\emph{Current}& \small{
        Graphy is a startup dedicated to democratising data analysis by providing a platform for people to easily build reports without a deep knowledge of data science.
        During my time here, I helped grow the company from a small engineering team of just two developers up to two independent engineering teams working together.

        \item Part of growing the team from an early start-up stage with two developers to a fully-fledged organised company with multiple engineering teams.
        \item Experienced with interviewing engineering candidates from junior to senior and helping to design the recruitment process.
        \item Overhauled our early startup platform to a TypeScript based, well-structured application using service based architecture, with an extensive unit testing and integration testing coverage.
        \item A core part of implementing engineering standards and processes, such as a rigorous testing framework as well as a code review process with a strong CI pipeline.
        \item Implemented an early stage deployment pipeline for the core project, which was used to test and deploy the project on a much quicker release cycle.

                         This application used Java Spring Boot microservices and Angular 2 to import data from multiple sources of record to better inform users of changes occurring in their respective lines of business.
                         This tool was designed with a core focus on best practices and user experience and received great feedback across its users.

                         \item Maintained and re-architected a start/end of day status reporting tool for applications to provide an easily accessible wide scoped view of availability.
                         Also implemented fine-tuning of the application's Hibernate/Spring Boot implementation to achieve a 3 times speed increase across the board.
                         \item Managed and mentored several graduate/intern new hires, educating them about programming principles, practices and standards in a working environment.
                         Including direct management experience of a 10 week intern hire.
